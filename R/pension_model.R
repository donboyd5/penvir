#' Run a Pension Model on a Specified Pension Fund Environment
#'
#' Executes a pension model using the functions and data contained within a
#' specified environment. The function currently calculates the benefits
#' associated with the pension fund and is designed to be extended with
#' additional calculations, such as funding.
#'
#' @param fund_env An environment containing the necessary data and functions
#'   for the pension model. The environment is expected to include a
#'   `calculate_benefits` function, and may also contain other functions and
#'   data relevant to pension modeling.
#'
#' @return A list with the results of the pension model. Currently, the list contains:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{benefits}{The calculated benefits from the `calculate_benefits` function.}
#' }
#'
#' @details
#' The `pension_model` function is designed to operate on a specific environment
#' representing a pension fund. The environment should include a
#' `calculate_benefits` function that returns the total benefits for the fund.
#' The function is structured to allow for easy extension with additional
#' calculations, such as funding, which can be uncommented or added as needed.
#'
#' This function provides a flexible framework for pension modeling, allowing
#' users to input different environments representing various pension plans.
#'
#' @examples
#' # initialize_environments()
#' frs <- get_fund("frs")
#' results <- pension_model(frs)
#' print(results$benefits)
#'
#' @export
pension_model <- function(fund_env) {
  benefits <- fund_env$calculate_benefits()

  list(
    benefits = benefits
  )
}
