#' Run a Pension Model on a Specified Environment
#'
#' Executes a pension model using the functions and data contained within a specified
#' environment. The function currently calculates the benefits associated with the
#' pension fund and is designed to be extended with additional calculations, such as funding.
#'
#' @param fund_env An environment containing the necessary data and functions for the pension model.
#'   The environment is expected to include a `calculate_benefits` function, and may also contain
#'   other functions and data relevant to pension modeling.
#'
#' @return A list with the results of the pension model. Currently, the list contains:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{benefits}{The calculated benefits from the `calculate_benefits` function.}
#' }
#'
#' @details
#' The `pension_model` function is designed to operate on a specific environment representing
#' a pension fund. The environment should include a `calculate_benefits` function that returns
#' the total benefits for the fund. The function is structured to allow for easy extension
#' with additional calculations, such as funding, which can be uncommented or added as needed.
#'
#' This function provides a flexible framework for pension modeling, allowing users to
#' input different environments representing various pension funds.
#'
#' @examples
#' initialize_environments()
#' get_data("frs")
#'
#' # Assuming 'frs' is an environment with the necessary functions and data:
#' results <- pension_model(frs)
#' print(results$benefits)
#'
#' @export
pension_model <- function(fund_env) {
  benefits <- fund_env$calculate_benefits()
  # funding <- fund_env$calculate_funding()

  list(
    benefits = benefits
  )
}
